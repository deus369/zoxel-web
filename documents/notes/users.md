> Give me a first person depiction of a player, playing this game

As I sit down to play the voxel RPG in space, I am filled with excitement. I have heard so much about this game, and I can't wait to see what it has to offer. I start up the game, and I am immediately struck by the procedurally generated everything. The voxels, textures, UI, and audio all come together to create a truly immersive experience.

I begin my journey on the first planet, and I am immediately drawn in by the quests and challenges that the game presents. I am able to customize my character and choose my skills and stats, which makes the game feel truly unique and personalized. As I explore the planet and complete quests, I am constantly surprised by the variety and creativity of the game.

I spend hours playing the game, and I am constantly amazed by the sheer amount of content it has to offer. The procedural generation ensures that no two play-throughs are ever the same, and the game is constantly surprising me with new challenges and adventures. I am hooked, and I know that I will be playing this game for many hours to come.

> describe a possible unhappy review

I recently played the voxel RPG in space, and I have to say that I was extremely disappointed. Despite the fact that the game boasts procedural everything, I found that the voxels, textures, and UI were all extremely repetitive and uninteresting. The quests were dull and uninspired, and I found myself quickly losing interest in the game.

Furthermore, the game's audio was incredibly poorly done, and it detracted from the overall experience. The game's developers tout the game's inspiration from Minecraft, Warcraft, and LITRPG novels, but in my opinion, it falls far short of the quality of those games. Overall, I would not recommend this game to anyone, and I will not be playing it again.
