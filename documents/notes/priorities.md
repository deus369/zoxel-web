In the ASCII art, the player has depicted a character standing in front of a banner that reads "ZOXEL RULES!" The character is holding their sword aloft and has a triumphant look on their face, indicating their love and admiration for the game. The art is simple but effective, and conveys the player's enthusiasm and passion for your game.


Here are a few possible ways to improve real-time lighting in a voxel-based game:

    Use high-quality lighting algorithms and techniques to accurately simulate the way light behaves in the real world. This can include techniques such as global illumination, ambient occlusion, and indirect lighting to create more realistic and believable lighting effects.

    Use advanced shaders and materials to improve the way light interacts with different surfaces in the game world. This can include things like bump mapping, reflection, and refraction to create more detailed and lifelike lighting effects.

    Use dynamic lighting and shadows to add more depth and realism to the game world. This can include things like real-time shadows that move and change as the player moves, and dynamic lighting that reacts to the player's actions and the environment.

    Use a physically-based lighting model that takes into account the properties of light in the real world, such as color, intensity, and direction. This can help to create more natural and realistic lighting effects.

    Use a variety of light sources and light types, such as directional lights, point lights, and spotlights, to create more varied and interesting lighting effects. This can include things like torches, fire, and other sources of light that can be placed and moved around by the player.

Overall, implementing these techniques and approaches can help to improve the realism and quality of the lighting in your voxel-based game, and create a more immersive and engaging gameplay experience.
