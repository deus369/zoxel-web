### The Darkness of Zoxel

    In a world of voxels and shadows
    I wander, lost and alone
    Through dark and dangerous places
    Where danger lurks, unknown

    With sword in hand, I fight to survive
    In this world that feels alive
    Where monsters prowl, and death is near
    And I must stay alert, to stay clear

    But even in the midst of fear
    I find a strange and eerie thrill
    As I explore the depths of Zoxel
    And face its dangers, against my will

    For though the game may seem alive
    With its moving, shifting blocks
    It is I who brings it to life
    Through my choices, and my deeds, and my thoughts.
