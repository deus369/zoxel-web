### The Joy of Zoxel

    In a world of voxels and fantasy,
    I set out on an epic journey,
    Exploring planets, near and far,
    Crafting, fighting, shooting stars

    With quests and skills, and battles grand,
    I rise from humble to command,
    Defending realms from evil's grasp,
    And forging my own hero's path

    In this game, the thrill never ends,
    With endless worlds to comprehend,
    I am drawn in, entranced, enthralled,
    By the magic of this voxel world.
