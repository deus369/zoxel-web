> I am making a voxel rpg, in space, with planets. Everything is procedural, the voxels, the textures, the uis, the audio, the quests, the stats, the skills. It is inspired by minecraft, warcraft and litrpg novels. Please make me a poem about it after a player has played through it for 1000 hours.

### Voxel Quest: A Journey Through the Stars

    A thousand hours spent in a world of voxels,
    Exploring the vastness of space,
    From planet to planet, each one unique,
    Procedurally generated, a never-ending race.

    With quests to complete and skills to master,
    The player becomes a hero of the stars,
    Crafting and building, an adventurer at heart,
    Battling foes and overcoming all odds.

    The UI and audio add to the immersion,
    A world of wonder, brought to life,
    The player becomes a part of this creation,
    A world of endless possibilities, without end in sight.

    Through Minecraft and Warcraft, the inspiration is clear,
    But this game stands on its own,
    A true testament to the power of procedural generation,
    A voxel RPG, unlike anything ever known.
