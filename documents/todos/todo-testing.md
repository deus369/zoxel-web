To-Do Testing
-----

I need robust testing for modules and systems

[Back](todo-main.md)

-----

`Current`

- [ ] Make shell script go through sub folders and test files
- [ ] Compile test results into a database
- [ ] Display database as a graph
- [ ] Run on raspberry pi daily

`Testing`
- [ ] Automated testing, run on server?
    - run tests weekly on pi
    - display output onto a ui somewhere

-----

- [ ] Look into Github actions for testing
- [ ] Dopa uses go task and ssh to run scripts within docker
