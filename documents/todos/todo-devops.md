    - just need a light weight window app to replace SDL
- [ ] Audio library for playing sounds - sending them to the sound buffer?
- [ ] Image processing library - png sequencing from bytes

Building
- [ ] Get android build to work
    - [ ] Hello world Example with C code
    - [ ] SDL example

`Documentation`
